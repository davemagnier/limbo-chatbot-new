Q: Questions about ‘The Garden’ staking platform
A: Our New Garden Platform is designed to reward our holders with SEED 
points by them planting/staking their seeds. Stakers will get a daily 
reward for planting their seeds and will be able to harvest a range of fruit 
grown by their seeds every 7 days.

- FRUIT = SEED Points!  
- Fruit are worth a lot of SEED Points so if that’s something you want to 
maximise it’s a good idea to stay on top of your harvesting, as any 
gardener will tell you, tending your garden takes some thought.

Q: How do I plant my seeds?
A: Simply connect your wallet that contains the seeds and navigate to the 
‘Garden’ tab on the left menu, you will need to select the seed you want 
to plant and click the ‘plant’ button on the bottom of the page. You will 
then be asked which type of soil you would like to plant your seed in. 
There is more information on soil types below. Once you have chosen your
soil type you may need to perform 2 transactions, one to approve and a 
second to plant. Then your seed is planted and you will see your 
countdown to your first harvest begin!

Q: How do I harvest my fruit?
A: Once you plant your seed in The Garden it will start a growth cycle, after 
which you will be able to harvest your first fruit, this period is 7 days. So 
every 7 days you will have fruit ready to harvest. The type of fruit and its 
rarity depends on the soil you have chosen to plant in. So choose 
carefully, you can change your soil after each harvest, simply use the 
change soil button.

Q: How to unplant/withdraw my seed?
A: You can unplant your seed anytime you like, the moment you confirm you 
want to unplant your seed your current harvest will stop and a countdown 
will begin before you can withdraw your unplanted seed to your wallet. 
The unplanting process takes 6 days, after which you will be able to 
perform a withdraw transaction to return the seed to your wallet.

Q: What do the soil types mean?
A: Soil type is important and a decision you will have to make, but can of 
course change. Terra soil is stable, producing 1 of 5 healthy regular fruit, 
each fruit is always worth the same amount of points. Enigma soil will give
you wildly unpredictable versions of those fruit, ranging from spoiled fruit, 
worth 0 points to Ethereal worth a heap points. You decide your strategy!

Q: How many SEED Points does each planted seed generate a day?
A: 
- Staked Ancient Seeds (With time remaining on their previous stake): 250 SEED Points per day  
- Ancient Seeds: 200 SEED Points per day  
- Mythic Seeds: 50 SEED Points per day  
- Synergy Seeds: 5 SEED Points per day  

Q: How many fruit does each planted seed generate per harvest?
A: 
- Ancient Seed: A wheelbarrow full  
- Mythic Seed: A basket full  
- Synergy: A handful  

Q: What are Synergy Seeds?
A: Synergy Seeds are our third seed collection, they are soil-bound so are not
tradable and are only available by earning a referral in The Garden, being 
a member of a partner community, or by being on the legacy allowlist. 
Synergy seeds are minted by receiving a code to enter in the Referrals 
section on The Garden. Once minted they are minted directly into a choice
of soil, hence they are ‘soil-bound’. Synergy seeds can earn points and 
grow fruit to harvest but existing seed owners cannot use them in their 
garden, they are for new gardeners only. You will receive 5% of all seed 
points generated by someone you have given a synergy seed to, so 
choose wisely.

Q: What do the SEED Points do?
A: SEED Points are going to be the key to participating in the future of our 
ecosystem, the most SEED Points you accumulate the larger your part in 
what comes next. SEED Points are the ALPHA. Reminder: SEED Points 
always accrue to the seed itself, sell your seed, sell your points!

Q: Does it work on mobile?
A: Yes it does.
